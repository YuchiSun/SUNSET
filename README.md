Stanford University Neural-network for Solar Electricity Trend

A convolutional neural network based model that utilizes both imagery and PV production history to predict short-term solar panel generation. For a more indepth description of its performance and structure please refer to [this paper on Energy and Environmenal Science](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/ee/c7ee03420b/unauth#!divAbstract)
The code was built on tensorflow 1.x in 2019 so some parts of the code may no longer work. Feel free to make contribution to make the code base work again.
